As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store and 2.1 million Android apps available on Google Play. In this project, I act as a data analyst for a mock company that builds free for download Android and iOS mobile apps in which its main source of revenue is its in-app ads. I analyze data from Google Play and the App Store to help the developers to understand that type of apps are likely to attract more users using the data science workflow. <br />
